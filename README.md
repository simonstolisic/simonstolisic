Greetings good people, I’m @simonstolisic

I’m interested in cybersec and familiar with:

C++,C#, WebDev and SQL since Highschool
Java and Python at University

In an ideal world I'll be using my applied knowledge to fight for justice( and maybe end up in jail for doing so, depends on how the world progresses).
